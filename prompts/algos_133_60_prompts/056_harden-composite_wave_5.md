Work only on the already-implemented batch `composite_wave_5`.

Rows in scope:
- combination:11 — RL Allocation Controller
- combination:12 — Hierarchical Controller / Meta-Policy

Fixtures to verify:
- fixture.composite_rl_policy_stub_v1

Check blocker state carefully:
- blocker.rl_environment_v1

Tasks:
- Review the batch implementation for correctness, reuse of shared helpers, and output normalization.
- Strengthen fixture coverage and expected-behavior checks.
- Add or improve tests for registration, parameter validation, short history or warmup handling, behavior, and performance-smoke coverage as appropriate.
- Check diagnostics and report payload fields so the dashboard can explain strategy outputs.
- Promote manifest statuses only if the evidence supports the promotion.
- Regenerate the tracker with `python scripts/build_algorithm_library_tracker.py`.
- Do not start unrelated batches.
- Do not mark rows `production_ready` without evidence.
- Run relevant tests.
- Stop when done.
