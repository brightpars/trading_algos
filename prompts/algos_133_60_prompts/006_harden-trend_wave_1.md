Work only on the already-implemented batch `trend_wave_1`.

Rows in scope:
- algorithm:1 — Simple Moving Average Crossover
- algorithm:2 — Exponential Moving Average Crossover
- algorithm:3 — Triple Moving Average Crossover
- algorithm:4 — Price vs Moving Average
- algorithm:5 — Moving Average Ribbon Trend

Fixtures to verify:
- fixture.trend_monotonic_cross_v1
- fixture.trend_whipsaw_guard_v1

Tasks:
- Review the batch implementation for correctness, reuse of shared helpers, and output normalization.
- Strengthen fixture coverage and expected-behavior checks.
- Add or improve tests for registration, parameter validation, short history or warmup handling, behavior, and performance-smoke coverage as appropriate.
- Check diagnostics and report payload fields so the dashboard can explain strategy outputs.
- Promote manifest statuses only if the evidence supports the promotion.
- Regenerate the tracker with `python scripts/build_algorithm_library_tracker.py`.
- Do not start unrelated batches.
- Do not mark rows `production_ready` without evidence.
- Run relevant tests.
- Stop when done.
